# Digital accessibility 101: Essential for some, useful for all!

*1 in 5 New Zealanders live with a disability.*

How do these people access digital products and services?
How might we, the creators, ensure that our creative works are accessible?

This bootcamp will introduce you to the wonderful world of digital accessibility. 

You will learn about different types of disabilities, and strategies that different access needs use to access digital products. You will also get tips on simple ways you can design and develop a more accessible experience.

Like all SoT bootcamps, bring an open heart, and a curious mind. For some, this will be an emotional rollercoaster. For others, it’ll be a fascinating insight into how the web was crafted with accessibility in mind, and what we can do to keep it that way.

I’m Prae, an accessibility focused UX engineer who loves helping people make accessible web products, and host of Web Access Club podcast. Looking forward to seeing you all!

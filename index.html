						<p>Kia Ora, Sawasdee-ka, and hello.</p>
						<p>I'm so happy that you've joined us, to learn a little about accessibility with me today.</p>
						<p>I hope that by the end of this 40-45mins talk, you will have a better idea of what is digital accessibility</p>
						<p>You'll get a better sense of who it's for, why it's important for both you and your audience/users.</p>
						<p>My dearest wish, is to inspire you to create works that cater for the <em>diverse</em> group of users who uses it.</p>

						<p>Ok, a little bit about me</p>

						<p>I‚Äôm a UX engineer, who loves helping people create accessible web products.</p>

						<p>And creator of Web Access Club, an accessibility podcast for web creators. Launching later this year.</p>

						<p>I‚Äôve been in the NZ tech industry for about 9 years now, specialising in UI front-end web development.</p>

						<p>I have a lot of experience working with UX practitioners, including researchers and designers. So I have a deep appreciation for UX.</p>

						<p>In my free time, I practice Japanese archery, watercolours, and eat around town. I am a little bit of a foodie.</p>

						<p>In the last couple of years, I‚Äôve started to dive into wonderful world of web accessibility. Afterall, UI front-end‚Äôs bread and butter, HTML, plays a crucial role.</p>

						<p><span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span> That is why I‚Äôm here</p>

						<p>This year, I'm studying to become an internationally certified accessibility practitioner. Yes, it exists!</p>

						<p>What all that means, is that right now, I'm no master at accessibility. There's so much I don't know, but I've committed in learning the craft.</p>

						<p>As we all know, the best way solidify your learning, is to share it.</p>

						<p><span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span>Who‚Äôs better than the new generation of web creators!</p>
						 
						<p>For engineers like myself to create the most accessible product possible, all of us need to be able to understand different users‚Äô access needs.</p>
						
						<p>This session is for anyone involved in creation of digital product. Future BA, scrum masters, developers, designers, contetn writers, and etc.</p>

						<p>Ok, lets get down to business. What is web Accessibility?</p>
						<p>I love <a href="https://digital.govt.nz">https://digital.govt.nz</a>‚Äòs explanation:</p>
						<blockquote>Web accessibility is about inclusion ‚Äî making sure everyone, including disabled people and those using assistive technologies, can access online information and services.</blockquote><span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span>

					<h2 id="slide6">What is<br>web accessibility?</h2>
					
					<p>
						Inclusion and access to <br><strong>information</strong> 
						and <strong>services</strong>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So what this is saying, people need to be able to access and use the web.</p>
						<p>Why is it important that everyone have access? Because</p>
						<p><strong>Information</strong> leads to knowledge. Knowledge <strong>empowers</strong> people</p>
						<p>A person who can't read very well can still learn about a their rights, if you've used simple language, or provide audio alternative.</p>
						<p>What about <strong>services</strong>? Services <strong>enable users</strong> to achieve their goal</p>
						<p>Someone who can't speak will struggle to call a call center. But if service is also available online, they can use online form to use the service.</p>
						<p>With both of those examples, having alternative way to access informatio and services doesn't just benefit those who needs it. But also those who just happen to prefer those channels.<span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This is what we called, a curb cut effect.</p>
						<p>Curb cuts, were initially designed for wheel chair users to safely get off the footpath, and cross the street.</p>
						<p>But when people were asked what they think the curb cut was for, cyclists thought it's for them. Parents with strollers thought it's for them. Same as the delivery person.</p>
						<p>Many groups benefit from things being designed for ease of access.</p>

						<p>Speaking of access needs, what are the different types out there?</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When I started learning about disability, I was so scared of referring to someone as ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù. </p>
						<p>Is that an offensive way to refer to a group?</p>
						<p>But after talking to advocates, reading user stories, and watching demos, I realised no, ‚Äúdisabled people‚Äù is exactly what we should be using.</p>
						<p>It‚Äôs <strong>social model of disability</strong>, which is especially relevant when us creators create things for people to use.</p>

						Types of disabilities

					<img class="stretch"

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>A <strong>blind</strong> person can be disabled from using a site that isn‚Äôt well designed for screen readers.</li>
							<li>A <strong>wheel chair rider</strong> post hip surgery can be disabled by narrow groceries self checkout.</li>
							<li>A person <strong>cooking with dirty hands</strong> could be disabled from using recipe software if it doesn‚Äôt allow for voice dictation.</li>
							<li>A person with <strong>severe ADHD</strong> was disabled from finding product information, because of heavy use of distracting looping animations in the marketing site.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In all of these usage of the term ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù, you‚Äôll notice that it‚Äôs how the technologies have been designed that <strong>disabled and barred users with different access needs from helping themselves</strong>. </p>
						<p>By not considering, or designing with these users, <strong>design stops these communities from becoming independent</strong>.</p>
						<p>It is the creators saying: <strong>The problem is with you, not the tool</strong>.</p>
						<p>Wow, what a way to create an inclusive world.</p>
						<p>It‚Äôs especially scary to think about, when anyone can become ‚Äòdisabled‚Äô at any point in their lives.</p>

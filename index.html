						<p>I'm so happy that you've joined us, to learn a little about accessibility with me today.</p>
						<p>I hope that by the end of this 40-45mins talk, you will have a better idea of what is digital accessibility</p>
						<p>You'll get a better sense of who it's for, and why it's important for both you and your audience/users.</p>

						<p>I‚Äôm a UX engineer, who loves helping people create accessible web products.</p>

						<p>I‚Äôve been in the NZ tech industry for about 9 years now, specialising in UI front-end web development.</p>

						<p>I have a lot of experience working with UX practitioners, including researchers and designers. So I have a deep appreciation for UX.</p>

						<p>In my free time, I practice Japanese archery, watercolours, and eat around town. I am a little bit of a foodie.</p>

						Inclusion and access to <br><strong>information</strong> 
						and <strong>services</strong>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So what this is saying, people need to be able to access and use the web.</p>
						<p>Why is it important that everyone have access? Because</p>
						<p><strong>Information</strong> leads to knowledge. Knowledge <strong>empowers</strong> people</p>
						<p>A person who can't read very well can still learn about a their rights, if you've used simple language, or provide audio alternative.</p>
						<p>What about <strong>services</strong>? Services <strong>enable users</strong> to achieve their goal</p>
						<p>Someone who can't speak will struggle to call a call center. But if service is also available online, they can use online form to use the service.</p>
						<p>With both of those examples, having alternative way to access information and services doesn't just benefit those who needs it. But also those who just happen to prefer those channels.<span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This is what we called, a curb cut effect.</p>
						<p>Cub cut is a small ramp built into the kerb of a pavement to make it easier for people using pushchairs or wheelchairs to pass from the pavement to the road; a dropped kerb.</p>
						<p>As I mentioned, these were initially designed for wheel chair users to safely get off the footpath, and cross the street.</p>
						<p>But when people were asked what they think the curb cut was for, cyclists thought it's for them. Parents with strollers thought it's for them. Same as the delivery person.</p>

						Types of disabilities

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When talking about types of disablites, I love showing this image from Micrsoft Inclusive Design toolkit.</p>
						<p>It highlight a spectrum in which someone could become disabled.</p>
						<p>Along that spectrum, you may not be able to touch, see, hear, speak or think permanently, temporarily, and situationally</p>
						<hr>
						<p>When I started learning about disability, I was so scared of referring to someone as ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù.</p>
						<p>Is that an offensive way to refer to a group?</p>
						<p>But after talking to advocates, reading user stories, and watching demos, I realised no, ‚Äúdisabled people‚Äù is exactly what we should be using.</p>
						<p>There's nothing wrong with anyone in this chart.</p>
						<p>It‚Äôs <strong>social model of disability</strong>, which is especially relevant when us creators create things for people to use.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A <strong>blind</strong> person can be disabled from using a site that isn‚Äôt well designed for screen readers.</li>
							<li>A <strong>wheel chair rider</strong> post hip surgery can be disabled by narrow groceries self checkout.</li>
							<li>A person <strong>cooking with dirty hands</strong> could be disabled from using recipe software if it doesn‚Äôt allow for voice dictation.</li>
							<li>A person with <strong>severe ADHD</strong> was disabled from finding product information, because of heavy use of distracting looping animations in the marketing site.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In all of these usage of the term ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù, you‚Äôll notice that it‚Äôs how the technologies have been designed that <strong>disabled and barred users with different access needs from helping themselves</strong>. </p>
						<p>By not considering, or designing with these users, <strong>design stops these communities from becoming independent</strong>.</p>
						<p>It is the creators saying: <strong>The problem is with you, not the tool</strong>.</p>
						<p>Wow, what a way to create an inclusive world.</p>

					<h2 id="slide7">How to create<br>an accessible experience?</h2>

						Start with content and HTML, not visuals

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>How do most of these magical tools allow users to access web products? <span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span></p>
						<p>Text content, HTML, CSS, and JS my friends. Plain and simple.</p>
						
						<p>You may have been sick of the 'content is king' saying</p>
						<p>There's no truer saying in the field of accessibility</p>
						<p>What are the users actually on your web product for?</p>
						<p>It's information and services. Visuals is a secondary way to deliver that information</p>
						<p>When I work with a designer who starts imagining a flow in pure text experience first, 70-80% of the accessibility problems will be resolved at the design phase.</p>

						<p>Then it is up to developers to drive the rest home, using the most semantic HTML code possible</p>
						<p>Marking up what the page is about as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, marking something users can interact with as <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, marking links to different urls as <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, and etc. all make your content accessible to these tools.</p>

					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When you start with visuals, it's easy to focus on the layout, the colours, the typography, the imagery, and other visual cues to hint at actions users can take. It's fun!</p>
						<p>But often, it's very hard to translate the 'feel' of colours and typography to access needs users, using assitive tools.</p>
						<p>As a sighted user, I can quickly scan the visuals to understand what your product and services is about.</p>
						<p>Screen reader users and keyboard users cannot take so much information all at once. Their tool only let them interact with your product one text or input at a time. So think about your user flow, and make sure to design that order explicitly and clearly. Don't make people jump around your page.</p>
						<p>The best designers and designs I've ever worked with, start from a linear text experience, which can be easily understood what read out loud.</p>

						<p>Another thing to do is to provide multiple ways to convey information</p>
						<p>When displaying images, think of how you want to explain that image to a friend over the phone. That's the text developers need from you to implement as an alt text.</p>
						<p>When posting a video, enable closed caption and or audio description for those who cannot hear, is working in a loud area without a headphone.</p>
						<p>When creating a podcast, provide transcript of the conversation. As a bonus, that is also good for SEO/google search!</p>
